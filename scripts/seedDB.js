We need to remove the burden of getting in shape and all the guilt and stress that surrounds it.  Paul’s objective is to give a clear perspective on healthy living - as a lifestyle, not a fad.\n\nWith Paul’s background as an elite athlete including 500-1000 mile races through jungles and as co-founder of Altus-Health.com he has a unique and varied perspective on health and fitness.
